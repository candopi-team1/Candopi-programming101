When you were very young, or when you are free from fear, you act natural.
Natural means you look around, move around, and touch/move/change things here and there.
Behave the same way in programming.
Change the codes any way you like. The more mistakes you make, the sooner you learn.

As long as you have a back up copy, as long as you can "undo" (Ctrl+Z thing), you are ok.
The computer won't burn and get smoky. It won't explode into you face. So, relax, have fun.


Ask, how is this a fun? I twill become fun.
