(1) Assume that any element is the smallest. Call it "value."
Inner loop makes space for that value, by moving bigger element to the right one-by-one.
Thus, a sorted sublist starts building at the start of your array.

(2) Outer loop resumes and goes on till the end.


Please study the images for Insertion sort.
