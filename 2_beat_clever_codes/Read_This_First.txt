DON'T INSTALL PYTHON for this lesson. Just read the code and try to understand, at least No. 3


Everyone, not only you, runs away when they see "clever" code.

Here we show you how to beat such clever-by-half code easily. "lambda_filter_map_3.py" beats the first two versions.


Don't run away. Don't feel insecure. If you understand "lambda_filter_map_3.py", enough.
Enough for now, and for a long time to come.
