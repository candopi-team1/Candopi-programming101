We are world best, because we have beautifully fused computer science with teaching methodology and fear-conquering psychology.
We are world best --- in every meaningful way. 
It is stupid to judge without trying our 'food' --- for free, for a few minutes.  


When you were very young, or when you are free from fear, you act natural.
Natural means --- you look around, move around, and touch/move/change things here and there.

Behave the same way in programming.
Change the codes any way you like. The more mistakes you make, the sooner you learn.

As long as you have a back up copy, as long as you can "undo" (Ctrl+Z thing), you are ok.
The computer won't burn and get smoky. It won't explode into you face. So, relax, have fun.


Ask, how is this fun? It will become fun. 


IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE:

(1) Say this mantra 3 times: "I'm alright. This person cannot teach. I will find a better teacher, a better book." 
    You will find millions.

As the great George Polya says, emotions is a big part of math teaching. Or any STEM teaching in general. Blame us. Don't blame yourself. 
Do you think we are Gods who can never err?

(2) Better still, tell us. We can, we will change this a million times for our students' sake. Try us.
